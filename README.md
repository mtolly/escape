A simple top-down action/puzzle game. Hit the switches to open the doors,
and get to the orange goal circle without getting shot by the turrets.

Use WASD, arrow keys, or mouse (click and hold) to move.
Made with HTML5 Canvas in CoffeeScript.

There's the obvious route where you open all the doors in sequence,
but you can also try to sneak past the gun on the right to skip two
of the buttons. It is possible!
